<h1>The Best Movies According to Neel Sagar</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is one of the best Sci-fi movies from Christopher Nolan. I like the twists and different situations of the movie and also the cast of the movies are great.</p>

<h3>In Time</h3>
<p>It's a great movie. In a future where people stop ageing after 25 and need to buy time to live, the rich become immortal while others cease to exist. So, Will is on the run with a hostage in a desperate bid to survive..</p>

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>Introduced to life in the fast lane through stockbroking, Jordan Belfort takes a hit after a Wall Street crash. He teams up with Donnie Azoff, cheating his way to the top as his relationships slide.</p>
